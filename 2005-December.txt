Subject: [X4juli-svn] [Bug #5949] Distribution package should be contained within directory
Message-ID: <200512211637.jBLGbQRD012216@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #5949, was updated on 2005-Dec-21 09:37
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: x4juli
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: gnuphie
Assigned to : none
Summary: Distribution package should be contained within directory

Details: For consistency with the vast majority of other packages I recommend placing the contents of the distribution .gz file within a single directory.

Most packaged distributed as a tar (.tar, .gz, .bz2) have a single directory root named the same (or similar) as the package name.

I know there is no technical necessity for this, but with this being the norm it prevents the extremely annoying unarchiving of the package into the current directory, scattering files into the existing directory hierarchy where they have no business being. Picking the scattered files out after the fact can be extremely time-consuming (and sometimes existing file are overwritten).

Obviously, one can inspect the existing contents before the extraction and realize what is about to happen, then create the proper directory first. But why make it hard for everyone?
