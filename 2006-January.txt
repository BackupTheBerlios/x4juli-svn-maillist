Summary: JULI logs to catalina.date.log if no <realm> in <host>

Details: With Tomcat 5.5.15:

With a vanilla logging.properties in ../WEB-INF/classes and no <realm> specified
in server.xml, and the <realm> specified in ROOT.xml - the logging file is
created as zero length, and any messages are logged in catalina.data.log.  Move
the <realm> tag to server.xml and logging occurs as expected.

There is a message thread on users at tomcat.apache.org with the following subject
concerning this issue:

"tomcat 5.5.15 - does JULI required a host tag defined realm?"

Comment:
I have downloaded and built to the latest nightly build of Tomact, and the logging is working correctly.

Thanks, Craig.
